    "The controller takes the decision whether to put the servers/DUs in light/deep sleep mode or not. The goal is to minimize the total energy consumption of the system over one frame, while ensuring that the total workload $L$ over all inter-connected DUs is timely served. The current frame workload $L$ is the traffic generated in the previous frame and queued in the system, hence known from the controller.\n",
